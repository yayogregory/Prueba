<p>Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights<br />
  Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise<br />
  Fade into view, oh,<br />
  It's been a while since I have even heard from you<br />
  (Heard from you)<br />
  I should just tell you to leave 'cause I<br />
  Know exactly where it leads but I<br />
Watch it go round and round each time</p>
<p>You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br />
  And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br />
  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br />
  'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br />
  You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt<br />
  And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br />
  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br />
  'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style</p>
<p>So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road<br />
  Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)<br />
  I say &quot;I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl&quot;<br />
  (Some other girl)<br />
  He says &quot;What you've heard is true but I<br />
  Can't stop thinking about you and I.&quot;<br />
  I said &quot;I've been there too a few times&quot;</p>
<p>'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br />
  And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br />
  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br />
  'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br />
  You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt<br />
  And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)<br />
  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br />
  'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style</p>
<p>Take me home<br />
  Just take me home<br />
  Yeah just take me home, oh</p>
<p>(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br />
  And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br />
  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br />
  'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style.</p>

<p>When you're on your own<br />
  and you feel you're lost,<br />
  when your heart's a mess,<br />
though you've given your best,</p>
<p>I'll be here giving it my best shot<br />
  baby your love's got more than I need.<br />
  Here, crying from the rooftops<br />
  nothing can stop us<br />
  if we believe.</p>
<p>Here, giving it my best shot<br />
  baby I find that we can be free<br />
  when you're here, here with me</p>
<p>When your sky is dark<br />
  and the earth is shaking your bed<br />
  your hope is at its end<br />
  you just need one friend</p>
<p>i'll be here, giving it my best shot<br />
  baby your love's got all that i need<br />
  Here, crying from the rooftops<br />
  nothing can stop us<br />
  if we believe.</p>
<p>Here, giving it my best shot<br />
  baby I find that we can be free<br />
  when you're here, here with me</p>
<p>When you can't find your way,<br />
  When all around you walked as deep and grayed<br />
  The stars fall from above and you're barely holding all my love</p>
<p>Giving it my best shot<br />
  baby your love's got all that I need.<br />
  Here, crying from the rooftops<br />
  nothing can stop us<br />
  if we believe</p>
<p>Here, giving it my best shot<br />

<p>Born to push you around<br />
  You better just stay down<br />
  You pull away, he hits the flesh<br />
You hit the ground</p>
<p>Mouths so full of lies<br />
  Tend to black your eyes<br />
  Just keep them closed<br />
  Keep praying, just keep waiting</p>
<p>Waiting for the one<br />
  The day that never comes<br />
  When you stand up and feel the warmth<br />
  But the sunshine never comes, no<br />
  No, the sunshine never comes</p>
<p>Push you cross that line<br />
  Just stay down this time<br />
  Hiding yourself, crawling yourself<br />
  You'll have your time</p>
<p>God, I'll make them pay<br />
  Take it back one day<br />
  I'll end this day<br />
  I'll splatter color on this gray</p>
<p>Waiting for the one<br />
  The day that never comes<br />
  When you stand up and feel the warmth<br />
  But the sunshine never comes</p>
<p>Love is a four letter word<br />
  And never spoken here<br />
  Love is a four letter word<br />
  Here in this prison</p>
<p>I suffer this no longer<br />
  I'll put it into this I swear<br />
  This I swear the sun will shine<br />
  This I swear, this I swear<br />
  This I swear!</p>

<p class="Naranja"><a href="http://youtu.be/y9uSyICrtow"><img src="Mars.png" width="309" height="309" alt="Mars" /></a></p>
<p>I've been up in the air<br />
  Out of my head<br />
  Stuck in a moment of emotion I've destroyed<br />
  Is this the end I feel?<br />
  Up in the air<br />
  Fucked up our life<br />
  All of the laws I've broken, loves that I've sacrificed<br />
  Is this the end?<br />
I wrap my hands around you neck so tight with love, love</p>
<p>A thousand times I've tempted fate<br />
  A thousand times I've played this game<br />
  A thousand times that I have said today, today, today</p>
<p>I've been up in the air<br />
  Lost in the night<br />
  I wouldn't trade out for you lies you lost for my life<br />
  Is this the end<br />
  You were the love of my life, the darkness, the light<br />
  This is a portrait of the tortured you and I<br />
  Is this the, is this the, is this the end?<br />
  I wrap my hands around you neck so tight with love, love, love</p>
<p>A thousand times I've tempted fate<br />
  A thousand times I've played this game<br />
  A thousand times that I have said today, today, today<br />
  A thousand times I've tempted fate<br />
  A thousand times I've played this game<br />
  A thousand times that I have said today, today, today</p>
<p>I've been up in the air<br />
  Is this the end I feel?<br />
  Up in the air<br />
  Chasing a dream so real<br />
  I've been up in the air (I wrap my hands around you neck)<br />
  Is this the end I feel<br />
  Up in the air<br />
  Chasing a dream, Chasing a dream</p>
<p>Take no more<br />
  Take no more<br />
  Take no more<br />
  I'll take no more</p>
<p>A thousand times I've tempted fate (I'll take no more)<br />
  A thousand times I've played this game (I'll take no more)<br />
  A thousand times that I have said today, today, today (I'll take no more)</p>
<p>Today (I wrap my hands)<br />
  Today (hands around)<br />
  Today (your neck)<br />
  Today (with love, love)<br />
  Today (I'll wrap my hands)<br />
  Today (around your neck)<br />
  Today (with love, love)<br />
  Today</p>
<p>I'll wrap my hands around your neck<br />
  I'll wrap my hands around your neck with love, love</p>

<p>Everyone is walking on the edge of life<br />
  Like a ghost of a shadow, barely alive<br />
  Even times in a rush<br />
But its going nowhere</p>
<p>Everyones connected but no one is connecting<br />
  The human element has long been missing<br />
  Tell me, have you seen it?<br />
  Have you seen it?</p>
<p>Or are we alone?<br />
  'Cause I need something to believe in<br />
  Tell me, are we alone?<br />
  Where is the life? Where is the feeling?<br />
  Is anybody out there?<br />
  Is anyone listening?<br />
  Is anyone left in this whole world?<br />
  Or are we alone?<br />
  Alone</p>
<p>Where is the feeling?<br />
  Alone<br />
  Where is the feeling?</p>
<p>Everybody needs to know<br />
  Somebody who cares.<br />
  Just a friendly face<br />
  You can trust to be there.<br />
  Are you afraid to be known<br />
  And not be a stranger?</p>
<p>Cause everyone's connected but no one is connecting<br />
  The human element has long been missing<br />
  Tell me, have you seen it?<br />
  Have you seen it?</p>
<p>Or are we alone?<br />
  'Cause I need something to believe in<br />
  Tell me, are we alone?<br />
  Where is the life? Where is the feeling?<br />
  Is anybody out there?<br />
  Is anyone listening?<br />
  Is anyone left in this whole world?<br />
  Or are we alone?<br />
